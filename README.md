## 1. Introduction

This is my first game written in pygame ( python ).

It's dedicated to a wonderful teacher and person, Dmitry Alexandrovich Chekanov. That's why the game is called chekanov.

## 2. Gameplay

a - run to the left.

d - run to the right.

space - jump.

escape - exit the game.


The main task of the game is to collect skewers with meat and dodge empty skewers. If you collect an empty skewer, you will lose. :pensive: :dizzy_face:

Maximum amount of meat on a skewer : 8.

| Empty skewer                    | Skewer with 8 pieces of meat                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |

Also there is mug with beer. If you collect it, you will change your orientation for 5 seconds. It means than left is right and right is left ( all actions are mirrored ).

If you are drunk, points are doubled.

As well you can't skip meat skewers because meat is life.
